- Hello
- What's Up
- Need to focus on work

# but how the hell do two cans of beer influence your working habits when they're sitting in the refrigerator?

- I have very lousy willpower, probably 6% in terms of strength between 0% to 100%
	
- I am addicted to making arbitrary excuses

## Did I say I'm sorry? ##

## And oh gosh, good beer went down b/c I have no willpower. Hmm.

- You never said they were YOURS. If they were, I definitely would leave them alone without any guilt. 
- Thought the sink would love a drink or two. 
- Love you

# Did I mention to you I'm silly & extremely apologetic?
