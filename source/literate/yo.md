  I knocked on so many  
  doors.

  I stopped counting 
  because too many  
  too many eyes  
  too many faces  
  were looking at me  

  some just sat in their living rooms  
  and ignored me  
  others slammed the door  

  I knocked and I knocked. 

  Until I found one  
  willing to take me in  
  I found ways to instill  
  comfort in the open sky  
  house that I am

  I found ways to distill  
  the pain, to dilute it  
  but can you ever dilute  
  the smell of vingear when  
  it's already out there, in  
  the air? 

  You can mask it  
  all you want  

  yet what you want is never  
  what the truth is.  

  If I could do it all  
  over again  

  I'd do it all again  
  All the same  
  Except just that  
  doing it in the opposite direction  
  would have been it 

  Because perhaps I 
  wouldn't have been taken in  

  Maybe I would have been too  
  nice lookin' for alcohol
   to  
  welcome me into its  
  house.
